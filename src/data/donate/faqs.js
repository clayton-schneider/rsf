    question:
      "What is the difference between a named memorial scholarship and a general fund scholarship?",
    answer: `Named memorial scholarships were created to honor a friend or family member. Named scholarships can specify reasonable restrictions relating to the awarding of the scholarship. The law also provides for financial restrictions on fully endowed named scholarships such that their total value cannot go below the originally endowed amount.
      General fund scholarships are financed from contributions from community members who do not wish to have their donation targeted to a specific named scholarship. There are no restrictions in the awarding of a general fund scholarship. Money in the general fund is also used to finance the day-to-day operations of the RSF.

If you are donating via mail, please send a note with the check specifying the memorial scholarship. If no note is provided, then your donation will go to our general fund.",

    answer:
      "If you wish to establish a permanently endowed named scholarship, you will need to raise at least $25,000. However, you have an opportunity to raise this amount over time. A permanently endowed scholarship will never be totally depleted. If you cannot or choose not to reach the $25,000 target, your named scholarship will eventually be totally spent down.",
