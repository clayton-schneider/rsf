_"I have to thank the Roxbury Scholarship Foundation for their support. I believe the best way to encourage tolerance and understanding of each other globally is through education. As I witness the individual talents of these amazing children, I hope I am fostering a thirst for knowledge, independent thinking, and curiosity. We can all strive to continuously learn from each other. Thank you, thank you for helping me achieve my dream of teaching abroad."_
