        Serving independently from the Directors is the Scholarship Awards
        Committee (SAC) which consists of five townspeople who serve for up to
        three years. This committee is informed by the Board of Directors of the
        total amount of scholarships to be awarded. The SAC receives and
        evaluates the detailed written applications and academic records,
        interviews each applicant, and recommends to the Board of Directors the
        candidatesâ€™ names and the amounts of the individual scholarships.

        None of this assistance would be possible without the generous
        contributions to the RSF by the citizens and friends of Roxbury. Each
        year every household in Roxbury is asked to contribute to the RSF.
