              The Roxbury Scholarship Foundation fills a vital need in our
              community by helping local students attend college. This academic
              year, the foundation awarded $111,800 in scholarships to 35
              students. Since the Foundation began in 1971, it has given more
              than $1.6 million to Roxbury students. The scholarships are based
              on need, character, and academic achievement, with need being the
              primary consideration. None of this would have been possible
              without generous contributions from the Roxbury Community.

              <br />
              <br />
              By supporting the Foundation, you are investing in the future of our
              townâ€™s youth.

              <br />
              <br />
              Since scholarships are available to people of all ages, you are also
              helping some adults resume their educations in order to further their
              careers.

              <br />
              <br />
              Please consider supporting the Foundation with a tax-deductible donation.
              Contributions may be made to the general scholarship fund, to one of
              our memorial scholarship funds, or by creating a new memorial scholarship
              on behalf of someone you wish to honor.
